This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)


	By default, the color is blue, but you can chose whateaver you want. When you hover the mouse, the div gonna change to selected color on the left side, you cannot no stop coloring the grid. I created a fake rubber, but it works the same way the colored ones. I Â´ ve learned a lot in this curriculum, but that taks was the better one for now. 
	
	I spent a lot of time getting familiar with html inputs and how to take them using the js with DOM and trying to fit the grid with every size, not changind the div(grid) size.
